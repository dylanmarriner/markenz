# Markenz Execution Roadmap

**Status:** Active
**Horizon:** 2026-2027

This roadmap aligns technical capability delivery with enterprise maturity goals. It is non-speculative and focused on committed deliverables.

## Near-Term (Q1-Q2 2026): Operational Hardening

**Goal:** Achieve Level 3 Operability (Automated Runbooks).

* **[Ops]** Automated Snapshot Rotation: Implement policy-based retention for periodic world snapshots.
* **[Docs]** Interactive API Explorer: Deploy static site for exploring the deterministic event schema.
* **[Gov]** Multi-Sig "Miracle" Transactions: Require N-of-M signatures for any manual state intervention.

## Mid-Term (Q3-Q4 2026): Distributed Scale

**Goal:** Parallelize non-causal simulation aspects (e.g., read-only client views).

* **[Arch]** Read-Replica Sharding: Allow 10,000+ observer clients without impacting simulation tick rate.
* **[Bio]** Advanced Immune System: Upgrade the stochastic infection model to a full pathogen-vector simulation.
* **[Perf]** SIMD Optimization: Vectorize the physics engine for 4x tick throughput.

## Long-Term (2027+): Ecosystem Federation

**Goal:** Allow inter-universe asset transfer (if governed).

* **[Proto]** IBC (Inter-Blockchain Communication) for Agents: Standardize the `AgentTransfer` protocol.
* **[Legal]** Cross-Jurisdictional Law: Enable treaties between separate simulation instances.
