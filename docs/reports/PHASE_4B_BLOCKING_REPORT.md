# PHASE 4B BLOCKING REPORT
## Frontend Command Center & Full Transparency UI

**DATE:** 2026-01-19  
**PHASE:** 4B  
**STATUS:** BLOCKED - AUTHORITY DOCUMENTS MISSING  
**AUTHORITY:** WINDSURF EXECUTION PROMPT PHASE 4B (REV 2.1)

---

## ⛔ CRITICAL BLOCKER: AUTHORITY DOCUMENTS NOT FOUND

### Required Authority Documents (ALL MISSING):

1. ❌ `docs/plans/HUMAN_SIMULATION_WINDSURF_AUTHORITY_PLAN.md` - NOT FOUND
2. ❌ `MASTER_PLAN_HUMAN_EQUIVALENT_AGENTS.md` - NOT FOUND  
3. ❌ `AMP_CANONICAL_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` - NOT FOUND
4. ❌ `AMP_BACKEND_FORENSIC_INVENTORY.md` - NOT FOUND
5. ❌ `docs/reports/PHASE_4A_COMPLETION_REPORT.md` - NOT FOUND

### Search Results:
- Searched entire workspace for all authority document names
- No matches found for any required document
- Phase 4A completion report not found (required for backend event stream verification)

---

## 🚦 EXECUTION STATUS: HARD STOP

**Rule Violation:** Phase 4B execution prompt states:
> "Proceeding if ANY authority document cannot be loaded → ⛔ STOP"

**Current State:**
- Authority precedence chain cannot be established
- Cannot validate Phase 4A backend event stream availability  
- Cannot determine exact agent state coverage requirements
- Cannot proceed without governance hierarchy

---

## 📋 AVAILABLE INFRASTRUCTURE ANALYSIS

### Existing Frontend Structure:
- ✅ React app at `apps/web/src/`
- ✅ WebGPU voxel renderer (`Renderer.tsx`)
- ✅ WebSocket infrastructure for chunk streaming
- ✅ Basic event system in `apps/server/src/sim/events.rs`

### Missing Components for Phase 4B:
- ❌ Agent state event streams (not found in existing events.rs)
- ❌ Biological variables streaming
- ❌ Hormones/neurochemistry visibility
- ❌ Psychological state broadcasting
- ❌ Memory structure access
- ❌ Decision/interrupt/veto transparency
- ❌ Internal thought/reasoning traces

---

## 🔍 NEXT STEPS REQUIRED

### Immediate Actions (BLOCKED):
1. **LOCATE** all missing authority documents
2. **VERIFY** Phase 4A completion and event stream availability
3. **ESTABLISH** authority precedence chain
4. **DETERMINE** exact agent state coverage requirements

### Alternative Paths:
1. **Create** missing authority documents (requires explicit approval)
2. **Proceed** with assumptions (violates execution prompt rules)
3. **Wait** for authority documents to be provided

## 📊 COMPLIANCE STATUS

| Requirement | Status | Notes |
|-------------|--------|-------|
| Authority Documents Loaded | ❌ FAIL | All 5 required documents missing |
| MCP READ Operations | ❌ FAIL | Cannot read non-existent files |
| Governance Hierarchy | ❌ FAIL | No authority precedence established |
| Phase 4A Verification | ❌ FAIL | Cannot verify backend streams |
| Execution Permission | ❌ FAIL | Hard stop condition triggered |

## 🎯 RECOMMENDATION

**IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED:** 
1. Provide all missing authority documents
2. Or explicitly authorize proceeding without them
3. Or create placeholder authority documents with explicit scope

**BLOCKING ISSUES:**
- Cannot determine agent state coverage requirements
- Cannot verify Phase 4A event stream compatibility  
- Cannot establish governance hierarchy
- Execution rules mandate hard stop

**REPORT AUTHORITY:** WINDSURF EXECUTION ENGINE  
**BINDING STATUS:** YES - This is a blocking report per execution rules  
**NEXT REVIEW:** Upon authority document resolution
