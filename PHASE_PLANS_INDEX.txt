MARKENZ GOVERNANCE PHASE PLANS - COMPLETE SPLIT
================================================================================

STATUS: ✓ COMPLETE AND EXECUTABLE

All 10 governance phases (0-9) have been split from the master roadmap into
individual executable phase plans. Each plan is complete, standalone, and
contains all required sections, tests, and traceability.

DIRECTORY: /docs/roadmap/phases/

================================================================================
PHASE PLAN FILES (11 total)
================================================================================

Phase 0:  MARKENZ_GOVERNANCE_PHASE_0_REPO_AND_EVENT_LOG_BASELINE.md
          → Offline stack, immutable event sourcing, determinism kernel

Phase 1:  MARKENZ_GOVERNANCE_PHASE_1_DETERMINISTIC_KERNEL_AND_REPLAY_HARNESS_LOCK.md
          → Prove determinism formally; lock DeterministicRng and snapshot

Phase 2:  MARKENZ_GOVERNANCE_PHASE_2_WORLD_REPRESENTATION_V1.md
          → Deterministic spatial reality; terrain, entities, inventory

Phase 3:  MARKENZ_GOVERNANCE_PHASE_3_EMBODIED_BIOLOGY_V1.md
          → Causal physiology; enforce BioVeto for impossible actions

Phase 4:  MARKENZ_GOVERNANCE_PHASE_4_OFFLINE_COGNITION_ENGINE.md
          → Deterministic minds, planning, learning, language (no LLM)

Phase 5:  MARKENZ_GOVERNANCE_PHASE_5_SOCIAL_DYNAMICS_AND_MULTI_AGENT_SCALING.md
          → Emergent social systems; scale to dozens of agents

Phase 6:  MARKENZ_GOVERNANCE_PHASE_6_GENETICS_AND_REPRODUCTION.md
          → Population growth via deterministic genetics and reproduction

Phase 7:  MARKENZ_GOVERNANCE_PHASE_7_GOVERNANCE_AND_ECONOMY.md
          → Deterministic law enforcement, elections, markets, courts

Phase 8:  MARKENZ_GOVERNANCE_PHASE_8_WEBGPU_RENDERER_AND_VISUALIZATION_UPGRADE.md
          → Professional visualization (non-authoritative read-only)

Phase 9:  MARKENZ_GOVERNANCE_PHASE_9_SECURITY_AND_INTEGRITY_HARDENING.md
          → Encryption at rest, tamper-evident logging, auth hardening

Phase 10+: MARKENZ_GOVERNANCE_PHASE_10_PLUS_FUTURE_GOVERNANCE_PLACEHOLDER.md
          → Framework for future phases (via law proposal + voting)

README:   README.md
          → Navigation and manifest for all phase plans

COMPLETION REPORT: /PHASE_PLANS_SPLIT_COMPLETE.md
          → Detailed summary of split execution

CONTENT PRESERVATION
================================================================================

✓ Zero Loss         — All requirements preserved from master roadmap
✓ No Reordering     — Phases in exact sequence (0-1-2-...-9)
✓ No Merging        — Each phase is standalone; no collapsing
✓ No Relaxation     — All prohibitions and constraints preserved
✓ Full Traceability — Each section maps to master roadmap source

================================================================================
STRUCTURE COMPLIANCE
================================================================================

Every phase plan contains (in exact order):

 1. Phase Objective
 2. Governance Domains In Scope
 3. Systems & Modules Touched
 4. Event Types (MANDATORY; no placeholders)
 5. Determinism Guarantees
 6. Enforcement Rules (BioVeto, PhysicsValidate, PolicyValidate)
 7. Audit & Replay Requirements
 8. Tests (MANDATORY) — executable requirements
 9. CI / Compilation Gates
10. Explicit Prohibitions
11. Phase Completion Criteria (checkbox list)
12. Authority Statement (binding)
13. Traceability (section → source mapping)

================================================================================
EXECUTION READINESS
================================================================================

✓ Phase 0 is bootstrap (no dependencies)
✓ Each phase has explicit 'depends_on' field
✓ Completion criteria define exit conditions
✓ CI gates provide checkpoints
✓ Tests are executable/automated
✓ All 8 Constitutional Principles always active (never weakened)
✓ Determinism guarantees are cumulative (never lost)

================================================================================
KEY INVARIANTS
================================================================================

→ Authority Law (Rust engine is ONLY world-state mutator) — INVIOLABLE
→ Determinism Law (same seed + events → same hashes) — CUMULATIVE
→ Transparency Law (everything observable/logged) — MANDATORY
→ Offline-First Law (no external network in authority path) — MANDATORY
→ Agent Parity Law (all agents identical except identity) — INVIOLABLE
→ Founder Amplification Law (bounded, non-inherited) — ENFORCED
→ No-Mock/Stub Law (no placeholders in tracked source) — CI GATED
→ Self-Evolution Law (state only, never code) — ENFORCED

================================================================================
HAND-OFF TO WINDSURF
================================================================================

These phase plans are ready for direct Windsurf execution:

1. Start with Phase 0 (bootstrap; no dependencies)
2. Execute each phase in order (0→1→2→...→9)
3. Verify each phase's CI gates pass before advancing
4. Run determinism tests continuously (must never fail)
5. Phase 10+ awaits governance approval (law proposal + voting)
